Google Protocol Buffer Example on Android
-----------------------------------------

This is [Google's Java Tutorial for Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/javatutorial.html) ported to Android. The AddressBook is serialized as a file on internal storage and displayed as a simple ListActivity. Person messages are passed to and from a second Activity via Intents as a Parcelable byte array for creates and updates.

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format. See the [protobuf project page](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) for more information and to download the compiler.
